# What is this?
This is a file index system specialized in the management of NetaSounds.
For example, I have a file named "@七海やちよ;$e4d592eb4a1f402f8024ee6838b50eea;=10bai,mouikanaito;&65817312732655616".
If I query "mouikanaito", then I will get the full filepath to it.
I can even put extra information into sourceInfo.json in order to make all the NetaSounds group by neta-source.
